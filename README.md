# Firefighter
The spiritual successor to Hobo Encampment

Play as a firefighter in a randomly generated house, trying to stop a fire before it spreads out of control!  With complex difficulty settings, infinite scenarios to generate (multiple origin points, dry season/wet season, gas leaks, sealed off rooms, etc.) and an assortment of loadouts, this text based game will satisfy your inner firefighter.  Most of the game is still in development, but you can expect fast progress.
